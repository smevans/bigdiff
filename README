bigdiff
=======

Allows comparision of parsed lines of files with millions of records in seconds.  Written in Perl.

 bigdiff:  Creates 3 files: in_only_file0 in_only_file1 in_both
 in the current directory.
 
 -f config_file Will define the fields for compairing.  The grouping of 
 fields is referred to as a record. The config_file is a perl script defining
 $file0, $file1, &read_record0, and &read_record1.  $record0, $record1, $line0,
 $line1, @other0, and @other1 should all be defined within the subroutine.  undef
 can be used as a place holder instead of @other if merge is not desired.  Output 
 is in the current directory.

 -c Checks the first line of the config_file.

 -m This merges the contents of both input files.  @other0 and @other1 must be 
 defined or only the record is printed.

 -l prints the entire line of file0 to in_only_file0 and the entire line of
 file1 to in_only_file1 and in_both.

 -s (sort): Sort on a field for input into bigdiff.
 Sorts both files by default and ads _s to the end of intermediate file.

 -su (sortuniq): Sort and Uniq on a field for input into bigdiff.
 Sorts both files by default and ads _su to the end of intermediate file.

 For a change in the output print field separator, define $final_OFS in the config file.
